            <h1>My Name is Ashwin J R</h1>
    <p>
      I have always been fascinated by technology. From a young age, I started
      coding and tinkering with different gadgets, and this love for technology
      has only grown stronger with time. I enjoy writing code and improving upon
      it, and my determination to learn and solve problems has made me a fast
      learner who does not quit.
    </p>
    <p>
      Currently, I am pursuing a B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Machine
      Learning, and I am on a mission to make a difference in the world. My dream
      is to build an AI company that can help solve some of the world's most
      pressing problems, such as poverty, hunger, and climate change. I believe
      that technology can play a vital role in finding solutions to these
      challenges, and I am excited about the prospect of using my skills to make
      a positive impact.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over the years, I have created numerous projects in both school and
      college. One of my most notable projects is a robot arm, which I designed
      and built myself. I have also created a robot vehicle that is used for
      waste collection in the forest and a few apps and websites. These projects
      have allowed me to hone my skills and put my knowledge into practice, and I
      am proud of what I have accomplished so far.
    </p>
    <p>
        In addition to my love for technology, I also enjoy playing badminton and football. Sports are a great way for me to stay active and relieve stress, 
        and I believe in maintaining a balanced lifestyle. It helps me stay focused on my goals and ensures that I am healthy and happy.</p>

        <p>
            In conclusion, my passion for technology, coupled with my determination to learn and solve problems, drives me towards achieving my goals.
             I am excited about the prospect of building an AI company that can help solve some of the world's biggest problems, and I am committed to making a positive impact.
              With hard work, dedication, and a love for what I do,
             I believe that I can make a difference and inspire others to do the same.</p>
